Most of the game went well, I was able to use the same concepts used last year to solve many of many problems, implementing OOP was harder than I thought, with only limited 
implementations and proper usage, but I was able to correctly add some, I ran into many roadblocks in the creation of the game, having to rely on friends or AI to create 
concepts I wasnt familiar in, like enemy chasing or the creation of the mazes because I found it a hassle to create them from scratch. I had many problems such as coins not 
spawning and variables not being defined, but in the end I managed to solve all of them. I have figured out many new concepts I was previously unfamiliar with. Another huge
problem I faced, was misplacing functions and lines of code, I would have to search through multiples files to find the error or the line of code I was missing creating
problems. Overall, I did pretty well, overcoming obstacles and learning new skills and habits, however, many features I wanted
to add were not added such as level selection and a new game screen.
