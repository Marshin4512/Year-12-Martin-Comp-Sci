Sorry I didnt sumit the things onto seqta
The documents are not in PDF format because I wanted to prove I actually did it and that I did not put this together at the last second. I also do not have the files on my laoptop and im afraid that downloading them will change the omdification time
The 3 files for delierable 2 are the class diagram word doc, the flowchart image and the psudeocode




Deliveralbe 1
-The game I have chosen is a puzzle maze game. The reason for this choice is because I find puzzle games to be simpler as I 
 do not need good visuals and can create a simple yet fun game. I am also unfamilar with the other game types and I had already 
 done a platformer last year

Requirements
-A game about solving puzzles in a maze needs to be created. 
-Target audience are teenagers and higher, game is not for small chidren due to their limited cognitive ability
-The objective is to create a puzzle game with a maze that contains puzzles or makes the player navigate a maze. It needs to have multiple levels that get progessively harder
 each level
-OOP needs to be correctly used. With proper classes and subclasses. Inheritance, polmorphysm have to be correctly used and implemented. Code must also be extremely modular,  with it able to be used in other projects with minimal adjustments

Plan/Design
-Player will navigate a maze/maze like building solving puzzles on the way, these puzzles get progressively harder and harder. Some will be easy, some may involve
 running from enemies.

 Code is the code, deliverable 3 is testing.
