-The game I have chosen is a puzzle maze game. The reason for this choice is because I find puzzle games to be simpler as I 
 do not need good visuals and can create a simple yet fun game. I am also unfamilar with the other game types and I had already 
 done a platformer last year

Requirements
-A game about solving puzzles in a maze needs to be created
-Target audience are teenagers and higher, game is simple but will get progressively harder
-The objective is to create a puzzle game with a maze that has levels that get progressively harder and harder
-OOP needs to be correctly used
