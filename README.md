-The game I have chosen is a puzzle maze game. The reason for this choice is because I find puzzle games to be simpler as I 
 do not need good visuals and can create a simple yet fun game. I am also unfamilar with the other game types and I had already 
 done a platformer last year

Requirements
-A game about solving puzzles in a maze needs to be created. 
-Target audience are teenagers and higher, game is not for small chidren due to their limited cognitive ability
-The objective is to create a puzzle game with a maze that contains puzzles or makes the player navigate a maze. It needs to have multiple levels that get progessively harder
 each level
-OOP needs to be correctly used. With proper classes and subclasses. Inheritance, polmorphysm have to be correctly used and implemented. Code must also be extremely modular,  with it able to be used in other projects with minimal adjustments
